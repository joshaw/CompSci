\section{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Generalisation Hierarchy Levels: 2
	\item M:N Relationships: 2
	\item Symetric Recursive Relationship: $1:1$
	\item Multi-valued Attribute: 1
\end{itemize}

\section{Astronomical Objects}
This database describes the classification of a few astronomical objects,
namely stars, planets and asteroids. Each of these objects has some aspects in
common and so a generalisation hierarchy is used. Each type of object has a
mass and an average distance that it lies from earth.

Stars are a type of object. In addition to the object attributes, they have a
luminosity, as viewed from earth. They can also exist in a binary system where
a star orbits at most one other star. Each star is made up of a number of
elements; hydrogen, helium, etc; each of which has an atomic mass and number.

Planets exist in isolation, but contain information about their orbital
duration, an optional star that they orbit (this must exist in the star table)
and a list of constituents that they are made from.

Asteroids have an associated eccentricity of their orbit (how non-circular it
is) as well as a number of discoverers who were responsible for finding and
measuring it.

\section{Business Rules}
\label{sec:business_rules}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item All stars, planets and asteroids are astronomical objects, called
		objects.
	\item Stars can orbit zero or 1 other star.
	\item Stars are composed of many elements and each element can appear in
		many stars.
	\item Planets are composed of two or more elements.
	\item Planet classification is either ``rocky'' or ``gasseous''.
	\item Asteroids all have one or more discoverers. Each asteroid can have
		multiple discoverers, representing a group discovery, and each
		discoverer can have discovered many asteroids.
\end{enumerate}
