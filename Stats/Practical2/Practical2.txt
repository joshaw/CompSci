Assessment 2 will be a 1 hour test

Test Content
============
The test will include multiple choice questions, short answer and numeric
answer questions as well as free text questions.

The questions will cover lecture and practical material as well as details from
the analysis of a dataset.

Lecture and Practical Content
=============================
The questions can cover ***any*** aspect of the course covered in the lectures
and practicals.

Analysis of a Dataset- Fitt's Law
=================================
A segment of the test will also ask questions on the analysis of a dataset
focusing on Fitt's Law.

Before the test, your task is to analyse the data (stats_fitts.csv- available
on Canvas) to test the following hypothesis:

H1
--
Icon width has a statistically significant effect on the reaction time to
select icons. Larger icons will take a statistically significantly shorter time
to select than smaller icons.

The experimental method used for collecting this data is specified in the
Method.pdf on Canvas.

You will be expected to have conducted the appropriate analysis before the
test. Therefore you will only be permitted to have access to your R and .Rout
analysis files as well as the data file during the test.

Amongst others, you should be able to answer the following questions:
What is the appropriate test?

What assumptions are needed to be met for that specific statistical test?

What does the test tell you?

What are the degrees of freedom?

Was it possible to reject the null hypothesis?
