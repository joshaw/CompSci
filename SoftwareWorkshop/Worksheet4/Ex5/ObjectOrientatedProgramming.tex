Object oriented programming is defined as

\begin{quote}
	\textit{using a methodology which enables a system to be modelled as a set
	of objects which can be controlled and manipulated in a modular manner.}
\end{quote}

This means that complex situations can be broken down and implemented in
managable peices and allows code to be grouped into semantically related
sections.

Object oriented programming is designed to address the issue of code re-use in
larger programming projects. Even at the smaller level, re-implementation of
code wherever it is needed leads to problems, for the developer, the maintainer
and, ultimately, the end user.

This conceptual model of programming offers a number of advantages over more
traditional programming methods and models, as well as a few disadvantages.

\section{Advantages}
For the developer not using an object oriented technique, as they are creating
a program, they must continually re-write code that they want to use from a
part of the program not directly connected to the current section.

For the maintainer, the act of updating the code written by the developer
becomes far more difficult. Every time the developer had to duplicate some
code, the fixes, updates or changes that are made to that code must also be
duplicated throughout the project. This redundancy can easily lead to different
implementations and a lack of consistency, causing confusion later on and
mistakes, meaning the code simply does not work.
