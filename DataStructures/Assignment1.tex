\maketitle

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Wikipedia Articles} --- \textit{Hash map.}

		\begin{itemize}
			\item Hash key is article title, hash value is the article text
				etc.
			\item Access times want to be fast for an article that is read more
				times than it is edited. For every access of an article, the
				title is used to locate the article which can be displayed, so
				the average and worst case times are equal, i.e.\ constant.
			\item When the article is edited, or a new article is added, the
				average case will still be constant. The worst case is when the
				hash map must be increased in sized and so all the articles
				have to be rehased, in which case there will be a significant
				time increase.
		\end{itemize}

		% \subsection*{Driving Lessons}
	\item \textbf{Driving Lessons } --- \textit{Tree set.}

		\begin{itemize}
			\item Just need to individually store the name of each customer who
				has had a free lesson.
			\item Set allows no duplicates, so a user cannot be added more than
				once.  If implementation allows, could check the customer's
				status in the set at the same time as adding them.
				\begin{itemize}
					\item When a customer tries to book a free lesson, try to
						add them to the set.
					\item If this fails, then they already exist so cannot have
						a free lesson.
					\item If it is successful, then they have their lesson, but
						if they try to book again, their name exists in the
						set.
				\end{itemize}
			\item When checking a name, the worst case is that they are not
				already in the set and so all elements have to be checked,
				i.e.\ linear, same for adding.
		\end{itemize}

	\item \textbf{Painting Prices} --- \textit{Tree map.}

		\begin{itemize}
			\item Want the items to be sorted, so add them using the price as
				the key (making the assumption that no two pictures have the
				same price) and any other information as the value.
			\item Insertion and deletion is $O(\log(n))$ for both worst and
				average cases, so access is fast. The items will be sorted by
				the key, so to get the most expensive items for a given price,
				the tree would be traversed to find the item less than and
				closest to that price, and then the next $n$ items below it
				returned.
		\end{itemize}

	\item \textbf{Birth Cities} --- \textit{Hash set.}

		\begin{itemize}
			\item The data would be stored simply as the name of that city in
				the set.
			\item To check if a city already exists in the set, the hash of the
				new city would be taken and that position in that array
				checked. If it is occupied, it is reasonable to assume that
				that city has already been added to the set, and so it is not
				added again.
			\item Adding to the set is simply a case of putting the new city
				into the array at the hash's position so will be constant.
				Searching for an item is also constant for both worst and
				average cases since a single position need only be checked for
				data.
		\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}
