To determine the relative effectiveness of each of these methods, they were all
executed and the time taken to complete was recorded. Below is the averaged
results of 20 such tests for each Dictionary data structure.

Overall, using the tree structure is the slowest, though this is almost
certainly due to the time taken to build the tree. There is little to
distinguish list and map.

Despite the time to build the trees and the time retrieving entries, a
consideration would also have to be made regarding insertion of new entries. In
this case, the Tree method should be the fastest due to its structure.
